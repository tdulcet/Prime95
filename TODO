1)  Should raw_estimate add together factoring, P-1, and LL test time?
2)  Accurate estimates for all work-types even those in progress.
3)  primecontinue should handle pXXXXXXX continuation files for pfactor.
5)  what about machines with low memory (how do we identify them?) -
	don't let them get any pfactor assignments

6)  Eliminate the database!   Use a different method of coordinating with
	the server.  (especially since the new p-1 bit won't fit)

7)  primenet.h must find a way to pass back the pminus1ed flag - right now
	I use how-far-factored > 100;  how to pass info to server that this
	client does not want p-1 work?

8) Adjust success probabilities upwards if p-1 has been done.

9)  clear exponents must be able to replace p-1 flag in test= lines.
